        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="My-Problem"><a href="#My-Problem" class="headerlink" title="My Problem"></a>My Problem</h1><p>For a long time I had an annoying problem. I have setup a <a href="https://nextcloud.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nextcloud</a> server at home. If you don’t know what <a href="https://nextcloud.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nextcloud</a> is, take a look at there website, it’s cool thing. But is not in the scope of this blog post. To sum it up, <a href="https://nextcloud.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nextcloud</a> uses port 443 and 80 because it’s a webapp. So now I can’t setup any kind of webserver at home (without being it on a not well known port), because <a href="https://stevessmarthomeguide.com/understanding-port-forwarding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">port forwarding</a> can only forward a specific port to one IP-address.</p><h1 id="When-I-discovered-Nginx"><a href="#When-I-discovered-Nginx" class="headerlink" title="When I discovered Nginx"></a>When I discovered Nginx</h1><p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nginx</a> can be used as a reversed proxy. This means you can have multiple DNS names pointing to one single IP-Address (e.g. the public IP of your router at home) and based on the DNS name the reverse proxy forwards the request to a specific webserver. So when I type server1.jakobstech.tk into the browser the request reaches nginx which forwards it to a local webserver and sends the response of the webserver back to me.</p><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>With this I finally have a solution to have as many webbased services at home as I want, well as long as my bandwith can deal with it.</p>]]></content>

I am going to show you the technologies I use and why I chose them.</p><h1 id="Github-Pages-for-Hosting"><a href="#Github-Pages-for-Hosting" class="headerlink" title="Github Pages for Hosting"></a>Github Pages for Hosting</h1><p>First I needed to find a webserver to host my blog on. I chose Github Pages, because its easy to configure and maintain. You can easily publish to it using a git repository. Moreover, a little bonus of Github Pages is the fact that it’s free of any charge.</p><h1 id="Hexo-as-a-lightweight-CMS"><a href="#Hexo-as-a-lightweight-CMS" class="headerlink" title="Hexo as a lightweight CMS"></a>Hexo as a lightweight CMS</h1><p>Additionally, I also wanted some kind of Content Management System instead to manage my blog posts easily. Unfortunately the most popular CMS like Wordpress and Joomla don’t run on Github Pages since they need PHP and an SQL Server to work.<br>Since Github Pages only lets you serve static pages I need a tool that does all the dynamic work when publishing the blog.<br>After searching a bit I found Hexo, a JavaScript based CMS that generates static pages which it is able to automatically publish to Github Pages. Personally as a developer I like Hexo for a number of reasons.</p><ul><li><p>I can manage it within a git repository, since my repository for that is also on Github I also have a full backup of my CMS without doing anything.</p></li><li><p>I like writing text in Markdown</p></li><li><p>I don’t need to use a special editor of the CMS. I can use whichever editor I want for writing my blog posts, since Hexo uses ordinary Markdown files.</p></li></ul><p>If you want to know more about Hexo you can visit their website <a href="https://hexo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hexo.io</a>.</p><p>My first experience with Hexo is great, it just works.</p><h1 id="Wait-how-can-there-be-comments-on-a-static-page"><a href="#Wait-how-can-there-be-comments-on-a-static-page" class="headerlink" title="Wait, how can there be comments on a static page?"></a>Wait, how can there be comments on a static page?</h1><p>That where the utterances-bot does its magic.<br>Just kidding, it’s not magic. It’s based on JavaScript and uses Github Issues to save the comments. So every user with a Github Account can comment. Since this is a technology focused blog, most of you will probably have a Github account.<br>Now that you know how easy it is to comment, I would be happy I you’d give it try. Since I don’t have any experience with blogging, I’d be happy reading your constructive feedback.</p>]]></content>
